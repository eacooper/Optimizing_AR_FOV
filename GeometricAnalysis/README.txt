The code in folder illustrates the geometric analysis of FOV coverage and plots the corresponding figures from the paper.

FOV_calc
- calculates the amount of total FOV and binocular region for a sample pair of camera frustum (Figure 11A)

dist_complete_overlap
- for convergent displays with different amount of asymmetry between nasal and temporal angles, calculate the distance at which the content has 100% binocular overlap (Figure 11B)
